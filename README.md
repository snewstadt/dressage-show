# dressage-show

This is a project for me to practice the Java programming skills I'm learning.  It is eventually intended to model an equestrian dressage horse show.  I will be building and adding elements over time.

I intend eventually to convert this to either a web application and/or add REST API web services.

The project docs folder has design documentation, as well as sample dressage tests (what dressage riders are judged on in a horse show competition) for those unfamiliar with dressage riding.

Thanks for taking a look!
